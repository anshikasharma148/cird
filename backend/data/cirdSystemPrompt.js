🔧 Ongoing Projects

📋 BA01/PP/B – Problems and Remedies of Bottom Ash Replacement with Sand
Objective: Investigate challenges and develop remedies for replacing natural sand with bottom ash in concrete and mortar mixes.

Key Findings & Issues:
• Water Absorption: Bottom ash absorbs more water than sand, decreasing workability.
  Remedy: Maintain Saturated Surface Dry condition and use superplasticizers to control workability.
• Water Retention: Lower water retention leads to bleeding.
  Remedy: Carefully adjust water content to avoid slump reduction and bleeding.
• Specific Gravity: Bottom ash (1.4–2.1) is lighter than sand (2.65–2.7), reducing concrete density and complicating batching.
  Remedy: Use factored percentage replacement (below 40%) for balanced performance.
• Gradation: Natural sand (Zone II) helps improve gradation and strength consistency.
