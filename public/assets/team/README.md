### Image Specifications

- **Format**: JPG, JPEG, or PNG
- **Aspect Ratio**: Square (1:1) recommended for profile pictures
- **Size**: Minimum 400x400 pixels, recommended 800x800 pixels for high quality
- **Optimization**: Compress images for web to ensure fast loading
- **Naming**: Use kebab-case (lowercase with hyphens) matching the team member's slug

## Notes

- Images will automatically display on team member cards and profile pages
- If an image is missing, initials will be displayed as a fallback
- The code automatically handles different file extensions (.jpg, .jpeg, .png)
- For special cases (like `dk-shukla.png` and `pmv-subbarao.jpeg`), the code includes mappings to match slugs to file names
- Supported formats: JPG, JPEG, PNG, WebP

## Team Members Without Images

The following team members currently don't have images and will show initials:
- Dr. Dhananjay R. Mishra (`dhananjay-mishra`)
- Er. Shashwat Shukla (`shashwat-shukla`)

To add images for these members, create files with the naming pattern: `{slug}.jpg` (or .jpeg/.png)
